# NBA Simulator
### This is the GitHub Repo for my data analysis of a my simulator <br>
In the data folder, you will see more folders with dates on it. <br> In each date you will see a number of files listed as the #<away team name<d>>vs<home team name<d>>.csv.
<br>Within that file there will be percentage which indicates the chance of that team winning on the given night.
<br>On top of the winning percentage there is also a Points Per Game (PPG) category for each player in the ten man roster.
<br>PPG is representative on the impact of such players. These numbers are based on statistics for each player.

<br>If you want a deeper dive into all the data, check out the link below which outlies the how well the simulator is doing this year!
